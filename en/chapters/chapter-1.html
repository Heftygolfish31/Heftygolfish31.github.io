            Cairns, burial sites and Cerrig Y Cledd (The Sword Stones) in the
            hills surrounding Barmouth suggest that the area was important
            during the Bronze Age. There is also much archaeological evidence
            from the Iron Age showing fortifications and structures in the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            A 5th Century inscribed stone was found on Ceilwart Isaf farm in
            Llanaber and another on the beach at Barmouth. The first stone was
            inscribed with “Caelexti Monedo Rigi” which can be interpreted as
            “Caelestis, Mountain King”, which suggests an early administrative
            unit in the area covering both the coast and the mountains or it
            could possibly refer to Caelestis Monedorix a mythical king of Mona
            (Anglesey). The second stone is inscribed with “Aeterni Et
            Aeternai”, possibly brother and sister. The first name could refer
            to Edernus, an early saint and son of Cunedda Wledig, king of the
            North Britons in the 5th Century. Edernus lived around 520-580CE.
            The stones can be seen in St Marys and St Bodfans Church in
            Llanaber.

            There is a recording of the River Mawddach in 1188 by Gerald
            Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales, the Archbishop of Brecon). During Henry
            II reign The Archbishop Baldwyn of Canterbury was sent to Wales to
            muster support for a further crusade to liberate Jerusalem. The
            Archbishop chose Gerald as his chaplain and they set out on their
            expedition across Wales supported by a troop of some 3000 armed men.
            Gerald travelled across the Dyfi to Tywyn, then over the Mawddach,
            probably at Llanelltyd where there was a ford and a ferry run by
            monks, before carrying on to Llanfair. There are some
            interpretations that assert that Gerald crossed the Mawddach by
            ferry from Penrhyn Point to Ynys Y Brawd and then by a second ferry
            from Ynys Y Brawd to the mainland where Barmouth now stands.
          </p>
          <p>Taken from The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwyn through Wales:</p>
          <p>
            “We slept that night at Tywyn. Early next morning, Gruffydd son of
            Conan came to meet us, humbly and devoutly asking pardon for having
            so long delayed his attention to the archbishop. On the same day, we
            ferried over the bifurcate river Maw, where Malgo, son of Rhys, who
            had attached himself to the archbishop, as a companion to the king's
            court, discovered a ford near the sea.”
          </p>
          <p>The following entry describing Merionnydd is interesting:</p>
          <p>
            “That night we lay at Llanfair, that is the
            <b>church of St. Mary</b>, in the province of Ardudwy. This
            territory of Conan, and particularly Merionyth, is the rudest and
            roughest district of all Wales; the ridges of its mountains are very
            high and narrow, terminating in sharp peaks, and so irregularly
            jumbled together, that if the shepherds conversing or disputing with
            each other from their summits, should agree to meet, they could
            scarcely effect their purpose in the course of the whole day. The
            lances of this country are very long; for as South Wales excels in
            the use of the bow, so North Wales is distinguished for its skill in
            the lance; insomuch that an iron coat of mail will not resist the
            stroke of a lance thrown at a small distance.”
          </p>
          <p>
            According to legend, the palace of King Gwyddno, ruler of the
            legendary Cantre Gwaelod, The Welsh Atlantis, was at Garandir on the
            sea-facing hillslope at, or near, Barmouth. A large enclosure
            half-way between Llanaber Church and Barmouth appears on Lewis
            Morris's 1748 map of the coastline which does not exist in any form
            today.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some period, a fortification, now known as Castell, existed above
            Barmouth guarding a route between the Church in Llanaber and a creek
            at the mouth of the Dwynant River. This creek would later be a “free
            landing place of the people”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Merioneth Lay Subsidy Roll of 1292-1293 recorded Llanaber as
            being relatively well off, worth between 30 and 40 shillings per
            1000 acres. They also record Llanaber as having 101 tax payers in
            the Parish at that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1294 a grant to a Bleddyn Fychan refers to lands in Maenol
            Llanaber with a small villa called Caer Hepnewid, perhaps lands near
            the Llanaber Church with Castell above.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a church at the site of St Mary's and Bodfan in the 6th
            Century built by St Bodfan. The church was rebuilt in the 13th
            Century.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1326 “a clansman of Llanaber was fined for keeping his animals in
            the common pastures of the old settlement after the township
            community had moved early in May with its animals to the mountains.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The poet Dafydd Ap Gwilym stayed at the inn Bwlch y Goedleoedd and
            wrote the poem Maddeunant around 1330 where he mentions Abermaw:
          </p>
          <p>
            “...Dafu'r gweuddiau dirfawr, <br />
            Digyffro fo Artro fawr, <br />
            Talwn fferm Borth Abermaw, <br />
            Ar dôn drai, er ei dwyn draw....”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bwlch Y Coedleoedd was situated near the Panorama walk on the old
            road to Bontddu. It is now a ruin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Egryn (a holding between Llanaber and Tal Y Bont) was identified as
            a hospice licensed in 1391 for the celebration of divine office. The
            licence was granted to Gruffydd ap Llewelyn ap Cynwrig “to have
            masses celebrated in the oratory of the poor hospital of St Mary the
            Virgin in the said diocese situate between two arms of the sea
            called Traeth Urtro (Artro) and Abermo, eight English miles apart,
            in which the tide ebbs and flows twice a day as far as the
            mountains, which are opposite the sea; the said hospital having been
            begun to be founded and built by him for poor and wayfarers and
            being difficult to access”.
          </p>
          <p>
            A 1530's report from a tour of Wales by John Leland the Antiquary
            mentions:
          </p>
          <p>
            “At the north of Maw river lyeth a little islet, scant a bow shot
            over, withowte habitation. At ebbe it is fresche water, and at
            fludde salt.”

            In 1565 Queen Elizabeth I commissioned a survey of the havens and
            creeks of Wales. This was said of Barmouth:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Abermowe, being likewise a haven having no habitation. But only
            foure howses, whereof there are owners Res ap Res, Haryy ap Eden,
            Thomas ap Edward and John ap Howell Goche. And there is nother Shipp
            nor vessel that belongeth to the same haven. But only towe little
            Bootes that the said Res ap Res and Hary ap Eden do use to cary men
            over that Passaige”

            In the mid 17th Century Robert Powell Vaughan wrote “Then Llan Aber,
            there at Aber Mowddach (usually called Bermo, in English Barmouth) a
            haven town: the River Mowddach, divideth itself into two heads,
            making a little Island called Ynys Brawd (the Friar's Island) and so
            poureth itself into the Ocean. In this town (Barmouth) also there is
            a military fence or trench, cast about the top of the hill, and
            called Dinas Gortin.” Taken from The History Of Meirionethshire.

            The island Ynys Y Brawd was an actual island before the causeway was
            built. The channel used to run between the island and Barmouth Beach
            as well as the existing channel that passes between the point and
            Penrhyn Point. Earlier than that, it used to run as the North
            Channel, as far as St.Marys in Llanaber. Long ago the harbour was
            probably somewhere along Church Street and it is believed that there
            are still mooring rings in the cellar of the Fanny Talbot
            (previously the Lion Hotel). It is possible that wrecks of old boats
            still lie under the main street. There was a time that the Georgian
            cottages of Water Street were the nearest to the water hence their
            name. It is also understood that there was a mooring area where the
            football field and The Wern now stand which afforded a safe mooring
            from North Easterlies.
