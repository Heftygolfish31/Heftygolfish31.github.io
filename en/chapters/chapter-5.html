          <p><b>The Churches and Chapels</b></p>
          <p>
            Since 1895 St John's Church has been at the heart of Barmouth life.
            Here the people of the town have gathered not only to celebrate
            national events but also to mark the important moments in their
            lives, at birth, marriage and death. St. John's is the home to our
            Christian Community who worship there every week. St. John's is
            surely one of the finest modern churches in Wales and visitors may
            wonder how this small seaside town came to be graced by such a
            magnificent almost cathedral like place of worship.
          </p>

            <p>St Mary 1872</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The mother Church of this Parish was first built by a 6th century
            Celtic Saint named Bodfan at Llanaber. The Church would be rebuilt
            during the 13th century and would later be known as the Church of St
            Mary and St Bofan. During the 19th century St Mary's was becoming
            small for the growing population of the area and the decision was
            taken in 1824 to build a Chapel of Ease in Barmouth itself.
          </p>

            <p>St David 1865</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Built in 1824 and opened in 1830, on the sight of a former
            shipbuilding yard, The new Chapel of Ease at Barmouth was dedicated
            to the Patron Saint of Wales, St David. Designed by Edward Haycock
            of Shrewsbury it was designed to hold around 470 people. For some
            years after it's opening, sand drifts proved to be a great source of
            annoyance to worshippers but with the arrival of the railway line in
            the 1860's this annoyance vanished. Barmouth was rapidly becoming a
            holiday destination since the arrival of the railway resulting in
            more people worshipping in both St Mary's and St David's. Both
            buildings were full and the then new Rector decided to do something
            about it.
          </p>
          <p>St Johns</p>
          <p>
            During the 1880's Rev'd Edward Hughes managed to get the Parochial
            Church Council to agree that a new Church building was the best way
            forward for solving the capacity problem at both Churches. Rev'd
            Hughes knew that many wealthy philanthropists had holiday homes in
            Barmouth and that they were willing to donate funds to the Churches
            as was demonstrated in the 1850's and 60's with repair work to St
            Mary's. One wealthy family in particular would eventually become the
            main donor of funds for the building of the new church. This family
            owned Plas Mynach and used it as a holiday retreat from their busy
            lives in Worcestershire. They were the Perrins family of Lea &
            Perrins Worcestershire Sauce fame.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Perrins family were able to to donate enough to build a large
            Church. During the 1880's the sea would come up to the railway line
            meaning land was in short supply. The Perrins family also donated
            some land they had purchased several years earlier. However the land
            overlooked the town and building the church would be difficult. A
            competition was held in a National building journal to choose a
            design. The winners were Mr John Douglas and Mr Daniel Fordham of
            Chester and it suited what Rev'd Hughes wanted from the new Church -
            a building large and ornate in scale.

          <p>
            Before work began on the project a lavish ceremony to lay the
            foundation stone was planned. It was hoped that Queen Victoria would
            lay the stone as she was touring North Wales in 1889. Since the
            Queen was unable to attend the ceremony she sent her daughter
            Princess Beatrice of Battenberg (said to be her favourite) to lay
            the stone. The ceremony began when she arrived in Barmouth by
            railway followed by a grand procession up to the site of the new
            church where the laying of the stone was completed.

          </div>
          <p>
            Work was progressing well on the new building. By 1891, almost two
            years since beginning the project, the tower was almost complete and
            all the roofs were ready for their slates to be fitted. Then on the
            evening of September 11th 1891 the tower collapsed into the building
            below destroying the roof and some of the walls. The architects
            thought that blasting the rock behind the church, to get more light,
            may have been the cause. The Rev'd Hughes began a new round of
            fundraising to complete the church. Mrs Perrins donated the
            remainder of the funds to complete the work and serve as a memorial
            to her husband James Dyson Perrins. The church was completed in 1895
            and consecrated on 18th April 1895.

          <p>
            In the 1800's the Catholic Community was small in Barmouth and
            worship occured in houses as there was no permanent place of
            worship. The Jesuits holidayed in Barmouth during the 1870's and
            1880's and provided for the Catholics during this time. In 1884 a
            Rev Thomas Donovan was appointed to the Barmouth Mission. He started
            to raise funds for building a permanent chapel. By 1891 a tin hut
            chapel was established in Park Road and dedicated to St Tudwal, a
            local saint. It was said to have opened on 11th September, the same
            day the tower fell down on St Johns. This was intended to be
            temporary and fundraising continued to pay for a new permanent
            church. In 1904 The foundation stone was laid for the St Tudwal
            Church on King Edward Street. The church was finished and opened in
            1905 at a cost of Â£5,041. It was the first Catholic Church to be
            built in Meirioneth since the reformation. The church was built with
            Minfordd granite and Cefn yellow sandstone dressings.

            It would not be right to discuss churches and religion without
            mentioning the numerous chapels in and around Barmouth. The chapels
            provided places of worship for other denominations. Most of these
            chapels are no longer places of worship and are now used for other
            purposes, but in their time were important busy sites for the locals
            to congregate. Walking around Barmouth it is easy to find these
            chapels.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1893 A Methodist chapel was constructed in Park Road. It was
            rebuilt in 1915 and is now used to store recovery vehicles for a
            local car dealer / garage.
          </p>
          <p>Caersalem</p>
          <p>
            In 1825 Caersalem Methodist Chapel was built but then sold to the
            railway around 1865. A new chapel was built on the high street in
            1866 and this was extended in 1911. The chapel is now a high-end
            furniture and homeware store.

          <p>
            Barmouth English Congregational Chapel was built around 1897. It has
            since been converted into the Dragon Theatre on Jubilee Road.

          <p>Siloam</p>
          <p>
            In 1828 Siloam Chapel was built in St Annes Square on Beach Road. It
            was rebuilt in 1870. It still stands but is now a shop selling
            beach, camping and novelty goods.

          <p>
            The Barmouth Zion Baptist Chapel was built in 1876. It lies between
            the florist and the Milk Bar in Beach Road, opposite Siloam. Like
            Siloam it sells beach goods and novelties.

          <p>Ebeneezer Chapel</p>
          <p>
            The Ebenezer Methodist Chapel was first built in 1806 and then
            rebuilt in a Gothic style. The interior was renewed, an organ
            installed, and land purchased for a Sunday School in 1880. It is
            still in the high street today and runs as a cafÃ© and shop named
            Ebeneezers.

          <p>Christ Church</p>
          <p>
            Christ Church Methodist Chapel was built in 1878 and is formally
            named Christ Church English Presbyterian and Calvinistic Methodist
            Chapel. This still serves as a chapel and is on the high street.
            Until recently it would host Welsh Language services for the old
            congregation of Siloam. The local guides, brownies and rainbows meet
            in the rooms above the chapel.

          <p>Capel Parsel</p>
          <p>
            Capel Parsel was a Calvanistic Methodist chapel built in 1800 and
            located in Llanaber, not too far from the Cemetery on the Barmouth
            side. It is now a private house.
          </p>
          <p>St Philips</p>
          <p>
            St Philips Church is located just off the road in-between Barmouth
            and Bontddu. It is part of the Caerdeon estate and was built by the
            owner of the estate in 1862 to provide English Language Worship.
            This was controversial at the time and caused some trouble with the
            predominantly Welsh speaking population of the area. The owner was
            taken to the Court of Arches by the Rector of Llanaber who refused
            to conduct services in English. The Rector won his case as the law
            was to conduct Welsh services in Welsh Speaking areas. As a result
            the Bishop Of Bangor introduced a bill in the House Of Lords,
            legalising English services in Welsh speaking areas. This lead to
            the English Services in Wales Act 1863. The church was not
            consecrated until 1875. It was licensed as a private chapel for the
            use of the owner of Caerdeon Estate who allowed the Oxford
            Undergraduates that would come to stay on the estate to use it.

          <p>
            The Moriah Calvinistic Methodist Chapel at Cae Gwian is located in
            the hills just outside Barmouth and was built in 1865. It would have
            served the Farmers in the area and also provided a Sunday School for
            farmers children.

            The independent cause (the Free Congregationalists) in Cutiau was
            founded in the 1770's but the chapel was not built until 1806, known
            as Capel Y Cutiau. There were repairs in 1866 and renovation in
            1912. Many farming families in the area and inhabitants of Cutiau
            would worship there. It is located above Glandwr Mill in the hamlet
            of Cutiau and is now a private home. Services were still being
            conducted there until 1995 with the Williams (Tyddyn) family
            predominantly taking care of the chapel and attending the services.
