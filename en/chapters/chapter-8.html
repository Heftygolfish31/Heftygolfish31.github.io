          <p><b>The Diamond</b></p>
          <p>
            The Diamond was a three masted square rigger built in New York City
            in 1823. She sank enroute to Liverpool from New York on 2nd January
            1825 after colliding with St Patricks Causeway, a natural reef
            sticking out approximately 8 miles to sea from Shell Island. There
            were thirty eight passengers onboard, eight of whom perished. There
            was also a cargo of cotton, pot ash and apples.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the cargo was washed up along the Coast Line by Dyffryn
            Ardudwy. Seeds from the apple cargo were planted in the garden of Tŷ
            Canol, a house in Dyffryn. From these washed up seeds a small apple
            orchard of ten trees matured to fruit vast quantities of both
            cookers and eaters. Several generations of the same family lived at
            the house and during Blodwen Davies era she would tell her
            Grandchildren the story of the trees and how they were sold locally
            as “The Diamond Apples” after the ship they had come from. These
            type of apples are very rare to the shores of the UK.

            <p>Glandwr Flour Mill 1885</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            As you leave Barmouth, to the East, there is a short section of
            straight road that's known as Glandwr. At the end of the straight
            there is a mill on the left and above the mill in the hills is a
            hamlet known as Cutiau. The mill produced flour which was
            transported by boat and had its own wharf known as Ffosycutiau.
            There was also a shipyard and local Farmers used the wharf to
            transport goods. A creek gave access to the wharf from the Mawddach.
            With the realigning of the road to the shore a bridge was built over
            the Dwynant River which closed off the creek and therefore access to
            the wharf. It also prevented the local farmers loading and unloading
            their goods. This stopped the shipbuilding but the farmers carried
            on loading and unloading from the bank by the road side. In 1877 the
            owner of the bank objected to this and took out legal proceedings
            against the locals. A London barrister, on holiday, heard of the
            case and believing it was unjust for the locals, took it on and
            subsequently won it. Local farmers such as Robert Williams of Tyddyn
            Pandy and Robert Williams of Caehir gave evidence, the former
            testifying that he remembered access to the wharf and its use from
            his childhood, which would have been the early 1800's. Enraged with
            losing, the landowner went in to Cutiau Chapel during a service and
            declared “You will never worship in this place again!” He then
            evicted all the cottage tenants and many other tenants. Cutiau went
            from being a bustling place to nothing almost overnight, there were
            said to be 100 chapel goers which were reduced to a handful. The
            dwellings were emptied. The chapel closed in the 90's, until then a
            local family had still been worshipping there.

            The Clock House has had many notable owners over the years. One
            owner was Charles Lowe who renovated it; the house did not have a
            clock tower originally. The building was originally a court house
            with cells. Prisoners would be brought in by boat and taken in under
            the house to cells in the dungeon. The courtroom was in the upper
            part of the house. Legend has it that there is a tunnel that goes
            from the house and under the road coming out in the courtyard
            opposite. Its purpose was to allow visiting judges to arrive by
            coach in the courtyard and pass safely to the courtroom away from
            the public.

            In 1890 Sangers Circus came to town. The circus arrived by

            procession was headed by elephants and they were also seen on the
            beach here at Barmouth. Sadly one of the elephants died while it was
            here and was buried at Cae Glas, which are the gardens opposite the
            Last Inn.

            A young Blodwyn Griffiths was sent to Barmouth to give birth to her
            illegitimate baby, the result of an affair with an English
            Gentleman. She was forced in to service as a nursery nurse for a
            local butcher who had seven children. One of her tasks was to take
            the two youngest children to the Min Y Môr, which served as a school
            at the time. Once there she was to ring the bell in the tower to
            call the children to class. While climbing the stairs she dropped
            her baby who succumbed to their injuries a week later. Blodwyn never
            recovered from the trauma and in 1889 could no longer cope with her
            guilt and her grief. One bleak and misty November night she was seen
            walking down to the shore where she bent down and picked up a small
            child. Cradling the child she continued walking until she
            disappeared beneath the waves. To this day when the mist rolls in
            people claim to hear the tolling of the school bell.

          <p>
            For centuries there have been sightings of a strange creature in the
            waters around Barmouth. Large footprints have been seen in the sand
            in the Mawddach Estuary and in Llanaber with other reports of a
            large sea borne object speeding through the waves. In the 1970's a
            small group of local secondary school girls were playing truant on
            Barmouth Beach. After being reprimanded they claimed they had seen a
            strange creature approaching Barmouth Harbour. This became World
            News at the time, the story gathered traction when the decomposed
            body of a giant turtle was washed up on the beach, however 30 years
            after this particular sighting one of the girls involved confessed
            to a friend that the story was made up.

            and they were washed up on the beach between Llanaber and Tal Y
            Bont, locals would move the slab and hide the cargo inside the grave
            to escape the Customs and Excise that were looking for it.

          <p>
            Tal Y Bont is a village to the North of Barmouth. Between the two
            places is a chapel named Egryn. In early December 1904 a religious
            revival was occurring and Mary Jones of Islawrffordd was doing her
            revival work at Egryn Chapel. While there she saw a large auroral
            arc stretching from the mountain to the sea with a star. Later in
            the month three people saw a large light to the South of Egryn
            Chapel with a “bottle or black person” in the middle and “some
            little lights scattering around the large light in many colours”. In
            early January 1905 a man reports seeing three lights in formation
            above a farmhouse and a woman saw lights between Dyffryn and
            Llanbedr. Other sightings were reported around Gwynedd in the first
            few months of 1905. Mary Jones reported seeing the lights several
            times and having visions of Christ and of Satan in the form of a
            black dog. A Beriah Evans saw five separate lights with Mary Evans
            between Islawrffordd and Egryn Chapel. The lights seemed to appear
            wherever Mary Jones went and seemed to strengthen the religious
            revival. They appeared in Llanfair, Bryncrug, Pwllheli, Towyn,
            Froncysyllte, Wrecsam and Ystrad in the Rhondda; all at the same
            time that Mary Jones was in these places. Reporters were sent from
            the Daily Mail, the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily
            Mirror who were full of scepticism but who were soon sending back
            reports of the lights, having witnessed them themselves. There were
            many witnesses to these lights and there occurrence in 1904 and
            1905. In her later years Mary became a recluse and was said to have
            turned her back on religion. In 1936 she died and was buried in
            Horeb cemetery in Dyffryn at one of the biggest funerals seen in
            North Wales. These weren't the first strange lights seen in the area
            though. In Harlech in 1662 strange lights were seen that reportedly
            set fire to crops and barns and infected grass, then in 1877 blue
            lights were seen over Pwllheli and the Dysynni Estuary.

            servant at Belle View Mansions (the large building behind the

            and then look forward again, as people that have say they witnessed
            a faceless Demon confronting them. Although there used to be an inn
            called the Old Bryn Gwynt Inn behind the church, so maybe the

            have accounted for these sightings.

            <p>Sword Stone Lying On Its Side</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            High up in the hills above Barmouth are two large slabs of rock, one
            lying on its side and one on its back. It sits in the middle of a
            field. What makes these stones special is that each one has the
            impression of a sword in it. There are many theories on how this has
            come to be, but two popular stories stand out. One is the sword in
            the stone and King Arthur legend, fuelled by the nearby King Arthurs
            Stones. The more known story is that The Ordovicians (a Celtic
            Tribe, led by Bendigeidfran) did battle against the Romans in AD76.
            The battle took place throughout the day on “The field of swords”.
            The Ordivices (the ancient Britons/ the original Welsh) outnumbered
            the Romans but were better armed. After battling all day the
            Chieftains agreed a peace and as a pledge that they would observe
            the treaty, Bendigeidfran through his sword in the air. As it landed
            it split a rock in two leaving the outlines of a sword that can be
            seen today.

            <p>Train crash 1883</p>

            If you look towards Fairbourne you will see Friog where the village
            meets the cliffs and runs along the coast. The railway runs along
            these cliffs from Fairbourne to Llwyngwril and a section of tunnel
            can be seen from Barmouth. This was the site of two separate train
            crashes with similar circumstances and similar consequences with one
            fifty years between them. On January 1 st 1883 a locomotive left
            Machynlleth for Dolgellau where the Eisteddfod was being held. The
            name of the engine was Pegasus and it was driven by William Davies.
            As he approached Friog, where the section of tunnel is now, he
            slowed down. As he reached the decline on this most treacherous
            piece of track, several tons of soil and rock came crashing down.
            The Pegasus derailed and went crashing down to the sea, killing
            William and his fireman. Luckily the couplings to the carriages
            snapped and the passengers were spared.

            Then fifty years later in 1933 the 0610 passenger and mail train
            from Machynlleth to Pwllheli approached the same cutting at the same
            spot where disaster had occurred half a century before, two thousand
            tonnes of earth and rock began to move. The train had slowed to
            fifteen miles per hour and synchronised with the slide. The engine
            and the tender were lifted over the parapet wall and turned where
            they became uncoupled from the coaches, again saving the passengers.
            However the engine and tender landed on the beach. Once again the
            Driver and the Fireman were killed instantly.
