            It seems that a ferry has existed at Barmouth as long as the town
            has, if not longer. The ferry was historically run by Monks,
            possibly from Cymer Abbey at Llanelltyd. Monks also resided in
            Barmouth at Plas Mynach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Barmouth is a natural harbour sheltered by surrounding mountains.
            There was a good approach, from the channel that exists today and a
            channel that ran between the island, Ynys Y Brawd, and the harbour
            (where the causeway is now)with navigable waterways all the way to
            Llanelltyd. In those days the harbour was probably somewhere along
            Church Street with the water running along Water Street.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Port Books of Milford record the first vessel bound for Barmouth
            as the Mary (Maru) of Fishguard in 1566, soon followed by the
            Michael of Milford. Early cargoes included grain, pilcorn, wheat,
            barley, oats and rye. Commodities which weren't available locally.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1587 there is a record of Le Angell de Bermo, an 18 ton vessel
            belonging to Barmouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a record in the Caernarvonshire Port Books 1630-90 that in
            1676 the Godspeed of Barmouth entered Pwllheli with a cargo of 6
            tons of oak poles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the late 1700's / early 1800's there were three shipbuilding
            yards in Barmouth with many more lining the Mawddach. 318 vessels
            were built between 1779 and 1790, that's between 6 or 7 a year - and
            some of which were big square riggers weighing up to 200 tons.

            By 1779 the town was flourishing and an increase in shipping saw an
            Act of Parliament passed. This act enabled the “repairing,
            deepening, enlarging and preserving the Harbour Of Barmouth in the
            County of Merioneth”. Barmouth Harbour Trust was created to put the
            act into effect. At this time the harbour was at Aberamffra, near
            the Clock House as you come in to Barmouth. The trustees erected a
            small stone embankment at a cost of £1660 which helped increase the
            depth in the harbour. Five years later a new quay was constructed.
            The main reason for this improvement was the Wool Trade. Money for
            the harbour improvements was raised by loans with the borrowing
            power restricted to £9,000. From this point the principle port of
            Merioneth was improved as the trustees and officials developed the
            harbour as they saw fit. More improvements were made in the late
            1800's.

            Barmouth became the most important port in the area and web or
            flannel were exported from here as well as stockings. Imports would
            include wood, wine, iron, corn, brandy, rum, tea, coal, tobacco,
            tallow, gunpowder, malt, butter, skins, ore, flour and lead as well
            as other items. There were many wealthy merchants in the town and
            schooners, brigantines and steamers came and went. Destinations
            included the Americas, France, Spain and Ireland. The Wool Trade was
            decimated by the War Of Independence in America which had a
            detrimental effect on the shipping industry in Barmouth for a while,
            but the advent of the North Wales Slate Export Trade took off in the
            early 1800's which saw an end to this period. Wool was still
            exported along with oak bark, timber, cheese and butter. Small
            sailing vessels would head up the Mawddach to fetch goods from
            landing places along the river. Square Riggers were a common sight
            at Barmouth before being replaced by Schooners.

            With increased shipping came dangers out to sea and a few attempts
            were made to build a lighthouse at Barmouth, to warn of the rocks.
            Each attempt failed with the structures being knocked down. The
            foundation of one is still here today at the Perch which can be seen
            just off Ynys Y Brawd.

            People of Barmouth have been volunteering to save lives at sea since
            1828, when Barmouth received its first lifeboat. To date there have
            been 10 lifeboats at Barmouth, starting out with oars before
            progressing to motor and now jets. The first two boats under oar
            were unnamed. The first named boat was the Ellen in 1868. The Ellen
            was followed by the first of two boats called the Jones-Gibb I and
            II, named after their donor, Mrs Jones Gibb of Tunbridge Wells. Oars
            then gave way to motor with the arrival of the Lawrence Ardern
            Stockport. Next was the iconic Chieftain which served the town from
            1948 to 1982 and the last boat to be slipway launched. The Princess
            of Wales came to Barmouth next, but too big for the boathouse she
            sat on a mooring just off the Barmouth Bridge. The next occupant of
            the mooring was the Moira Barrie who came in to service in 1992
            before being replaced in 2019 by today's lifeboat The Ella Larsen.
            We can't mention the lifeboats without referring to the D-Class
            Inshore Lifeboat which Barmouth first received in 1967. This was
            ideal for rescues in shallow waters, cliff edges and the estuary.
            Fast and manoeuvrable it became the workhorse of the fleet. The
            first D-Class in Barmouth was D-137. The home of the lifeboat has
            changed through the years in Barmouth. The first lifeboat house was
            on the quay. The location is believed to be the shed next to Davy
            Jones Locker, to the right as you face it. In 1859 the boathouse
            then moved to near the start of Barmouth Bridge, built in to the
            rock with its own slip. By 2004 the lifeboat was becoming tidally
            restricted as to when it could launch so a new boathouse was built
            on the Promenade with a tractor launch and recovery system, from the
            beach, to ensure 24/7 cover in the bay.

            In 1834 the Round House was built. It was built after a meeting
            between prominent residents and freeholders as a result of frequent
            drunken riots, usually late at night, also the Constables had
            nowhere to place the offenders until they were brought before the
            magistrates. An application was made to the Magistrates to pay for
            the lock up from county rates and another application that more
            special constables were appointed. The seafarers in the town would
            often drink heavily after long periods at sea. It wasn't just the
            sailors as there were a number of women who habitually caused
            disturbances as well. The building was erected in a circular shape
            with a dividing wall down the middle, one side for the men and the
            other for the women. The building is said to be round so there are
            no corners for the devil to hide in!

            By 1867 the railway arrived in Barmouth and this saw a rapid decline
            in shipping. The town experienced hard times for about ten years. As
            sail gave way to steam one of Barmouth's most famous vessels came in
            to play, The SS Dora. The Dora was a 296 Gross Ton Coastal Steamer
            who plied her trade mainly between Liverpool, Barmouth and Aberdovey
            in the early 1900's. Owned by the Aberdovey and Barmouth Steamship
            Company she was sunk on 1 May 1917 when returning from Belfast to
            Liverpool. She was stopped by a German U-Boat under the command of
            Otto Steinbrink who ordered the crew in to lifeboats before placing
            explosives on the Dora and scuttling her. The large building / shed
            on the quay that the toilet blocks are attached to is still known as
            the Dora Building to this day.

            As tourism grew in the mid 20th Century motor boat trips became
            popular and local boatmen would advertise on boards on the sheds by
            the quay. There were a dozen or so small boats, licensed to carry
            twelve, including the Skylark, the Enterprise, the Sally, the Pansy
            and the May Queen. Three larger boats, licensed to carry 36
            passengers, also provided boat trips they were the Prince of Wales,
            the Princess Royal and the Welsh Girl. As well as the ferry to
            Fairbourne the trips would go up the estuary to Penmaenpool, trips
            out in to Cardigan Bay and trips to Mochras / Shell Island. Trips to
            Penmaenpool were a favourite with an 8 mile passage up the glorious
            Mawddach. The journey gave the most spectacular scenery but required
            considerable seamanship and navigational skills. The channel was
            always changing and knowledge of the location of the sandbanks was
            required.

            At 10:55 on 22nd July 1966, Ned Jones aged 73, a man with over 50
            years of experience on the Mawddach set off for Penmaenpool in
            command of the Prince of Wales. There were 42 passengers onboard, 6
            more than it was licensed for; 15 were children between the ages of
            3 and 12 years. The vessel grounded twice on sandbanks on its voyage
            up the estuary. The Prince of Wales arrived at Penmaenpool at 1145
            with the flood tide running at full force between 4 and 5 knots. The
            vessel passed the jetty with the intention of turning to port to
            stem the tide for the approach to the jetty. It appears Mr Jones
            made the turn too late and was not turning as quickly as expected
            despite the tiller being hard over. In order to give the boat more
            speed he let go of the tiller to increase the speed of the engine.
            The boat was unable to complete the turn and the flood tide carried
            her to the bridge where she collided with one of the lower
            stretchers. These are solid beams that protrude from the upright
            members and are only visible at low water. This severely damaged the
            boat and left a large hole causing the boat to rapidly sink. Two
            lifebelts floated free and some passengers managed to reach these
            but the other lifebelts were tied to the boat and there was no time
            to release them. Despite the valiant efforts of Mr John Hall of the
            George III Hotel and his staff, 15 lives were lost. The tragedy
            affected the whole town and as a result all boat trips were stopped
            at the time.

            In the 1950's there was one lobster fishing boat on the Quay, the MV
            Thomas Sinclair. Then during the 1960's more lobster boats came to
            Barmouth from Pembrokeshire and Cardigan. Lobster fishermen were a
            hardy bunch and would fish here for about 9 months of the year. Then
            in 1973, Iolo Hughes, a maths teacher turned lobster fisherman from
            New Quay began landing bags of queen scallops from his boat, Seren Y
            Don. He had found a bed about 15 miles off Barmouth and would sneak
            out in the middle of the night. At first no one knew where he was
            fishing but soon the other fishermen found out and either converted
            or bought boats suitable for dredging. The boats could be out for
            over 36 hours at a time but it was very lucrative. Before long,
            boats came from Cornwall, France, Holland and Ireland, sometimes
            they would lie 6 or 7 abreast on the quayside. An ice plant was
            installed and huge refrigerated lorries belonging to the French firm
            Jarno were a regular sight on the Quay. The trucks would groan out
            of town under the weight of the scallops. As the scallops became
            scarcer the fishing trade dropped off, there was still some fishing
            through the 80's but eventually the numbers dropped to a small
            amount of vessels. Eventually leisure craft became the main type of
            boating in the harbour with a few charter fishing boats offering
            Mackerel Fishing for the tourists and of course the Fairbourne
            Ferry.

            Inspired by the adventures of Major Bill Tilman, The Three Peaks
            Yacht Race was started in 1977. Dr Rob Haworth, a local GP who knew
            Major Tilman, was going on holiday and decided to do it Tilman
            style, sailing from Barmouth to Caernarvon, climbing Snowdon, then
            sailing to Ravenglass and climbing Scaffell Pike, then onwards to
            Fort William and climbing Ben Nevis. While explaining his idea to
            his medical partner, Dr Merfyn Jones, Dr Jones suggested it would
            make a marvellous race and so the event was born. The race is held
            annually and at its height attracted between 35 and 40 boats.

            Although it has changed through the decades the Quay still remains
            the focal point of the town and has always remained a beautiful
            place to visit.
