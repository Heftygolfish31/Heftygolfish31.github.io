          <p><b>Mining</b></p>
          <p>
            Although it is South Wales that is famous for mining, there were a
            lot of mines in this area. At one point there were 24 mines
            operating although not all were successful. It is believed that gold
            was discovered in Meirioneth in 1834 but mining didn't start until
            1847, as the idea that there was gold in the area was ridiculed at
            first. A gold belt runs from Barmouth to the North of Bontddu. The
            two most famous mines are Clogau, which is above Bontddu, and
            Gwynfynydd which is above the head of the Mawddach Estuary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clogau mine is also known as St. Davids mine or Clogau St Davids. In
            1860 a vein of gold was struck and in just over three years the mine
            had produced £43,783 worth of gold. As word got out a Klondike type
            Gold Rush occurred with many new companies forming and people
            arriving to mine. Expensive machines were purchased and buildings
            built before the prospecting was complete. Not all the ventures were
            successful. The area bustled with life and work. Many farmers in the
            area would trek from their farms to work in the dangerous conditions
            of the mines. The workers would mostly stay in barracks at the mine
            in the week and head home for the weekends. The barracks sheltered
            hundreds. Barmouth did not benefit from the trade that these workers
            brought as much as Dolgellau did as most of the workers' wages were
            spent there.

            4 Barmouth businessmen created the Clogau Gold Mining Company in
            1891 and in the following 5 years £19,688 worth of gold was mined.
            By 1899 a new company was formed called Saint Davids Gold and Copper
            Mines who purchased the Clogau mine as well as others in the area.
            At its height there were around 100 miners employed in the Bontddu
            district. The company was successful at first but unfortunately the
            gold became scarcer and by 1910 the Clogau mine was closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Gwynfynydd mine was originally a lead mine, gold was first
            discovered there in 1864. Between 1888 and 1890 £35,000 of gold was
            extracted and then after that very little was found. The mine shut
            in 1916 when most of the miners were called up for the First World
            War.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1930 an enquiry opened in Dolgellau to look in to the possibility
            of restarting the mining in the area. The aim was to reduce
            unemployment; previous data of ounces was produced and the
            employment of 500 men were used. However it was felt that even
            though there were unexplored gold veins, their number and size were
            uncertain and the cost of exploring them could outweigh any return.
            A few attempts have been made to mine over the years since then but
            with no lasting result. In the 1950's a local farmer tried to
            re-open a Bontddu mine but this venture did not last long.

            The Clogau mine is the namesake of the Clogau Gold Jewellery brand
            which is world famous. Welsh Gold has been used in Royal Rings and
            Regalia for over 100 years. It is the most sought after Gold as it
            is the rarest. Many Royals have had their wedding rings made from
            Clogau Gold. They are:
          </p>
          <p>
            1923 - The wedding ring of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, on her
            marriage to King George VI, was made from pure Welsh Gold from the
            Clogau mine
          </p>
          <p>
            1947 - The wedding ring of Queen Elizabeth II on her marriage to the
            Duke of Edinburgh was crafted from a nugget of pure Welsh Gold from
            Clogau
          </p>
          <p>
            1960 - Princess Margaret's wedding ring from her marriage to Antony
            Armstrong - Jones (Lord Snowdon) was made from pure Welsh Gold from
            the Clogau mine
          </p>
          <p>
            1973 - Princess Anne's wedding ring from her marriage to Mark
            Phillips was made of pure Welsh Gold from Clogau
          </p>
          <p>
            1981 - The wedding rings of Prince Charles and Princess Diana were
            both made from pure Welsh Gold from Clogau
          </p>
          <p>
            1Kg of Welsh Gold from Gwynfynydd mine was presented to Queen
            Elizabeth II on her 60th Birthday in 1986. This may have been the
            source of gold for the Earl and Countess of Wessex wedding rings in
            1999
          </p>
          <p>
            An ounce of Clogau Gold was presented to the late Queen Elizabeth II
            to use for Prince William and Princess Kate's wedding rings.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as the gold mines Manganese and Copper were also mined in
            the area. In 1862 a firm named Barmouth Consols Copper, Silver-Lead
            & Gold Mining Co. Ltd was registered in London. It was trying to
            purchase a patch of land in Llangelynin but by 1878 the company was
            said to be “no longer carrying on in business.” A rich belt of
            Manganese ran between Barmouth and Harlech, in what is known as the
            Harlech Dome, which saw a chain of different mines running along the
            belt. There were many mines found directly around Barmouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Barmouth mine is located behind the house called Deronda , just
            above St Johns Church. It runs along the lower part of the path
            towards Graig Y Gigfran (The Peak). Its entrance can be seen and was
            the playground of many a Barmouth child. Barmouth mine consisted of
            a number of underground workings. A letter exists from the owner in
            Birmingham, a John Abraham, complaining of falling output to which
            the foreman replied that there was an epidemic of influenza in
            Barmouth. The mine existed from 1886 to 1891 and produced 1,261 tons
            in that time, on average employing 2 men. 1889 produced 545 tons
            alone. There are several entrances, two are on the path to the peak,
            one is next to the entrance to St Johns Churchyard and one is a
            dripping well located along the path behind Deronda. They follow a
            quartz seam.

            Dinas Oleu (The National Trust Land given by Fanny Talbot) is listed
            as a manganese mine. It is above the Barmouth formation which is
            above the Hafotty formation which contains a manganese ore bed.
            However it appears more like a stone quarry which can be seen over
            the road from the car park next to the Last Inn and up towards the
            Slabs above Panorama road.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cell Fawr Mine (The farm behind the peak) is connected to the
            Hafotty mine and the Cell Fechan mine (the ruined farm on the path
            to the peak) all of which run along the Barmouth to Harlech
            Manganese Belt. Between 1891 and 1892 Cell Fawr produced 954 tons
            and employed 8 people. A tramway existed between Cell fawr and the
            Hafotty mine. The Cell Fechan mine existed from about 1899 and
            produced 867 tons between that year and 1908. Its largest return was
            in 1900 when 277 tons were extracted. There is a network of tracks
            cut in to the slopes around the area which probably served the
            workings. Hafotty is located above Llanaber in-between the Cell Fawr
            and Egryn mines. The mine contains iron pyrites, manganese and
            quartz. The mine produced 12,204 tons between 1886 and 1900 and in
            1887 employed 52 people. 1890 was its best year producing 3946 tons
            and employing 34 people. Within the mine there was a tramway, which
            took the mineral to a loading point where a railway moved it to
            another loading point. From this point a horse drawn sledge took the
            ore to Barmouth Road near St Marys where a horse and cart would
            transport it to Barmouth Station. Usually three loads a day.

            Garn (alternatively Panorama) mine is located at the Panorama walk
            and has a distinctive, obvious mine entrance. It is unclear what was
            mined here but it is described as the Panorama Copper and Gold mine
            and the entrance is built in to the wall. The mine shaft is flooded.

          <p><b>Agriculture</b></p>
          <p>
            As can be easily seen, the hills around Barmouth are rocky and high
            with some grass land and some woodland. The area is not suitable for
            arable farming and the majority of farming in the area is pasture
            fields for livestock such as sheep, cattle and some horses.
            Comparing the fieldscapes of today against those over 150 years ago
            on maps, they have not changed much. It is easy to see the dry stone
            walls that appear all over the area and work their way down the
            slopes around the town and its outer limits. These walls are also
            well over a 150 years old and mark the boundaries of the fields.
            Much of the landscape in the area is steep sloped woodland
            interspersed with pasture fields. The wood ranges in age from
            ancient to semi natural to mostly modern.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the enclosures in the area are large and irregular in shape.
            Although no arable fields exist today there is evidence of what
            looks like post medieval land divisions probably for arable land
            cultivation, as it seems the fields had been cleared carefully of
            stones in what is a very rocky area. Upland areas were left as they
            are with no evidence of clearing taking place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually Meirioneth has always had one of the lowest proportions of
            arable land in Wales and England. Life would have been very hard
            farming the hills around here. Living on the high slopes and
            enduring the harsh terrain. Imagine the times when there was no
            electricity or fuel or running water or supermarkets, living on
            these farms high above the towns, on the slopes and in the valleys.
            Imagine a harsh winter! The only entertainment would be the chapel,
            for many this would be Cutiau. Many of the farms were tenant farms,
            that is where a landlord owned the land and a farmer would farm the
            land. Squires of the 1800's were known for gambling to entertain
            themselves. It was not unusual for a tenant farmer to wake up in the
            morning and find they had a new landlord. There was a case where the
            eldest son of one family inherited a large farm estate with a house,
            livestock, land and fishing rights. Within a short space of time of
            inheriting it, he lost the lot in one night of gambling and had to
            move his family into his brothers nearby farm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cattle and livestock would be either driven in to town to be
            auctioned off outside the Cors Y Gedol building or in Dolgellau. In
            fact it was not unusual to see sheep and cows wandering the streets
            of Barmouth up to the 1980's although this was usually a few
            escapees. The well known big landlords of the area in the past were
            Cors Y Gedol, Nannau and Lord Harlech.

            The wool trade was the biggest thing spanning the later parts of the
            1600's, the 1700's and the 1800's. In 1770 Barmouth port exported
            £50,000 worth of wool products all around the world. The sheep would
            be sheared at the farms and then the wool taken to mills where it
            would be made in to cloths on looms. There were very few factories
            in Wales before 1800 and almost all production was at home but as
            Trans Atlantic demand for Welsh Cloth grew Meirionethshire became
            dependant on the wool trade. Spinning and weaving gave a more stable
            and larger income than farming did. Some farms would have a fulling
            mill connected to it to full (thicken) the cloth. These mills were
            usually water driven but there are examples of horizontal mills in
            the area that were horse driven and used for grinding.

            Up above Glandwr Mill, where the Dwynant River flows down the valley
            lies a holiday home. This was once a farm called Tyddyn Y Pandy
            (Tyddyn - Homestead/Small Holding, Pandy - Fulling Mill). The same
            family farmed here for 150 years. Robert Williams kept a farm
            account book from 1843 to 1846. The book is a fascinating insight to
            how a farm operated in those times and shows transactions between
            Robert Williams and other local farms buying and selling cattle and
            timber as well as selling pigs and also butter to inhabitants of the
            town. One page shows the farmer paying wages to his workers
            including his miller David Jones. There are even drawings of the
            farm by his child, of the same name, who went on to be a Sea
            Captain. Interestingly there is an entry in 1845 for paying the
            doctor (pre NHS times) and then a coffin. This was for his first
            wife passing away, then later that year paying for the ring for his
            second marriage. There are many entries of him still doing business
            with his first father in law, Edward Williams of Cell Fawr.
            Roberts's son, Cadwaladr, and then his children would take over the
            farm eventually, though only one of them remained a farmer
            throughout his life.

            To illustrate the control of the estates in the area, a brochure
            from 1911 shows the sale of valuable farms, small holdings,
            accommodation and building lands and freehold ground rents with
            reservations. The sale was by the direction of Lord Harlech and took
            place at Cors Y Gedol Hotel, Barmouth. Many local farms were
            included. The following freehold and ground rents with reservations
            were offered:

            As has been seen previously farms such as Cell Fawr and Cell Fechan
            had mines on their land. It's said that Cell Fawr has a horse drawn
            horizontal grinding mill wheel. There is also a road that goes north
            from the farm and under this road there are holes. These holes used
            to be a larder for winter storage of food.

            Farms have seemed to diversify to survive over the years with
            camping, caravan sites, hydro schemes, building, local produce to
            name but a few.
