          <p><b>Jasper Tudor</b></p>
          <p>
            Jasper Tudor was the uncle of the future Henry VII / Henry Tudor. In
            The 1460's it is believed that Gruffydd Fychan of Cors Y Gedol, a
            Lancastrian supporter during the War of the Roses, built Tŷ Gwyn
            (The site of the Bronze Bell Wreck Museum) as a safe house for
            Jasper Tudor to secretly rendezvous with other supporters in Gwynedd
            while also affording a means of escape to the sea if it was needed.
            It seems Barmouth played a part in the plots and plans of Kings and
            War.

            in Barmouth and there are a row of cottages on the Rock known as
            Ruskin's Cottages. In 1874 they were given to him and his Guild of
            St. George by Fanny Talbot for a consideration of £1,000. They were
            to be used as part of Ruskin's social experiment to house the poor
            and prevent the forment of revolution.

            outside Barmouth, in 1869. He spent several weeks here revising the
            fifth edition of “The Origin Of Species”. This was his last visit to

            Fanny Talbot was born in Bridgwater Somerset in 1824. Fanny married
            George Tertius Talbot, a surgeon and they lived mainly in Bridgwater
            until his death in 1873. Fanny then used part of her inheritance to
            buy Tŷ'n Y Ffynnon along with some land and a few cottages on the
            slopes of Barmouth. Fanny Talbot donated some cottages to the poet
            John Ruskin for his Social Experiment, They soon became friends and
            corresponded regularly. She also gave one of the cottages to August
            Guyard. In 1895 the Cannon Harwicke Rawnsley, one of the funding
            members of the National Trust, visited Fanny at Tŷ'n Y Ffynnon and
            Fanny suggested that she might donate an area of land known as Dinas
            Oleu (The Fortress Of Light) to the trust. A few months later she
            did just that, donating four acres and this became the first piece
            of land ever donated to the National Trust.

            <p>Auguste Guyard</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Auguste Guyard was a Frenchman who lived in Barmouth. His friends
            included Victor Hugo who wrote Les Misėrables and the The Hunchback
            of Notre Dame, Alexander Dumas who wrote The Three Musketeers and
            The Count Of Monte Cristo and also Lamartine, a famous poet in
            France. While in France Auguste wrote a piece in his local paper
            about the rights of the worker which was against the period of King
            Louis Philippe and for which he was sent to prison. After his
            release he became editor of “Le Bien Public” a newspaper owned by
            Lamartine, which was influential in dethroning Louis and bringing
            the revolution of 1848. Guyard gave up politics after this and moved
            to a small village called Frotey. His plan was to make Frotey a
            utopia and a pattern for all villages in France, similar to Ruskins
            social experiment. He was awarded a gold medal for his endeavours by
            Napoleon III and Napoleons son awarded him a silver one. However the
            parish priest accused him of flouting the magesterium of the church
            and so he fled to Paris. War had broken out and Paris became
            besieged. Auguste fled Paris for the safety of Wales. So how did he
            end up in Barmouth? Fanny Talbots Son had gone to Paris to study Art
            where he met and married August Guyard's daughter. After she died he
            married her sister. When Auguste fled Paris Fanny Talbot gave him a
            cottage on the rock in Barmouth. He lived there until his death. He
            created the terraced gardens that can be seen there and when he died
            he was buried above the town as were his wishes. His grave can still
            be visited today and is known locally as “The Frenchman's Grave”.

            W.W.Greener was a famous gun maker from Birmingham. Rumour has it
            that in the 1890's he was travelling on holiday with his wife when
            the wheel of their carriage fell off. Mr Greener went to find a
            wheelwright in Barmouth and left his wife to wait on a rock. While
            she sat there she watched the sunset. Upon Mr Greener's return his
            wife told him of the beauty of the sunset and how she would love to
            live there. The result was that Mr Greener had the house that is
            known as Tŷ'r Graig built in 1892, (The Yellow Castle to locals).
            Looking down from directly above the building it looks like an open
            double barrel shotgun!

            <p>Commander Harold Godfrey Lowe RD</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            On 15th April 1912 fate propelled Harold Lowe in to the most famous
            Maritime Disaster ever. Harold Lowe was Fifth Officer of the Titanic
            when it sank in the Atlantic after striking an iceberg. Harold lived
            in Barmouth at Penrallt and learnt his boating and sailing skills
            here. When the disaster occurred he ended up in charge of lifeboat
            No 14. Initially he was involved in the evacuation of passengers and
            launching of lifeboats, women and children first. While loading the
            lifeboats he loaded up to 50 people before lowering to the water.
            With regard to the number he explained that it depends on the
            calibre of the man and upon the gear but he would not take more than
            50. At the later enquiry he was asked why he had loaded so many
            compared to Second Officer Lightoller who loaded far less, to which
            he stated: "I am different from another man. I may take on more
            risk, we will say, than you; or you may take on more risk than me".
            Eventually Fifth Officer Lowe with Second Officer Lightoller and
            Chief Officer Wilde began loading Lifeboat No. 14. Lightoller left
            and Wilde gave orders along the deck which left Lowe in charge and
            he put 58 in, he acknowledged that he had overloaded it at the
            enquiry but said he knew he had to take a certain amount of risk.
            Five Lifeboats had been launched without Officers and Lowe and Sixth
            Officer Moody decided an Officer should take Lifeboat 14. Moody told
            Lowe to go and he would get another boat, he never did. Lifeboat No.
            14 had only women and children, apart from one man who he took for
            rowing. Lowe also discovered an Italian man, at the last moment,
            dressed as a woman with a shawl over his head. As the boat was being
            lowered past the open decks a crowd of Italians rushed forward and
            fearing they might try and jump in to the boat Lowe fired his pistol
            3 times. At the enquiry he was asked if he had heard pistol shots to
            which he replied: "I heard them, and I fired them." Once in the
            water he gathered 4 other lifeboats and rafted them together so that
            he could place survivors in them before going back to look for more
            survivors. He was the only one to do this, as the other lifeboats
            feared being swamped by casualties. He saved a further 4 lives. For
            this action he was dubbed “The Real Hero Of The Titanic”. Harold was
            the only one to raise the sail on his lifeboat and this can be
            easily identified in the famous photo of the lifeboats approaching
            the Carpathia as his boat has the mast up. Harold can be seen as the
            one standing up at the tiller. After the enquiries and back in
            Barmouth he was given a Heroes reception at the Pavilion and
            presented with a commemorative gold watch inscribed with: "Presented
            to Harold Godfrey Lowe, 5th officer R.M.S. Titanic by his friends in
            Barmouth and elsewhere in recognition and appreciation of his
            gallant services at the foundering of the Titanic 15th April 1912."

          <p>
            Bill Tilman was born in 1898 and went directly from school at the
            age of 17 to serve in the Royal Artillery for the duration of the
            First World War. He was in the trenches as a gunner for over three
            years. Tilman fought at the battle of the Somme and was twice
            awarded the Military cross for bravery. After the war he left the
            army and sailed to Africa to become a coffee planter where he stayed
            for 10 years. Whilst there he met Eric Shipton, together they
            climbed the highest mountains in Africa such as Mount Kenya, Mount
            Stanley in the Ruwenzori range and Kilimanjaro. Legend has it that
            when Tilman returned to the U.K., he simply jumped on his bike and
            cycled from the east coast of Africa to the west coast to catch a
            boat to sail home. During the 1930's Tilman became one of the
            leading explorers in the Himalayan Mountains. He made the first
            ascent of Nanda Devi and he also made several trips to Everest. At
            the outbreak of WWII Tilman, although over age, volunteered and
            served in North Africa and then in Special Operations in Italy and
            Albania where he parachuted in behind enemy lines to work with the
            resistance. For his actions there he was awarded the Distinguished
            Service Order and was given the keys to the city of Belluno in
            Northern Italy which he helped save from occupation and destruction.
            After the war he declared that he was too old to be top class for
            high altitude climbing. Tilman was a talented climber and sailor but
            first and foremost he was an Explorer. So he bought an old Bristol
            Channel Pilot Cutter named ` Mischief ` and started to make long
            distance sailing expeditions with small scratch crews. He sailed to
            both the Arctic and Antarctic. His longest voyage lasted for a year
            and a day. In the 60's and 70's when he wasn't sailing he lived with
            his sister in Barmouth at Bod Owen near Glandwr and was the
            president of the Barmouth RNLI. In 1977 he agreed to go on an
            expedition to the South Atlantic to climb Smith Island, probably for
            the first time not in command or on his own boat but as crew. The
            boat made it successfully as far as Rio de Janeiro, but en route to
            the Falkland Islands in November of that year they disappeared
            without trace - it was presumed the ship had foundered with all
            hands.

            In 1933 Lloyd George and his wife came to open the new sea defences
            and promenade. While here he addressed a crowd in the town where he
            famously said: “If the Powers succeed in overthrowing Nazism in
            Germany, what would follow? Not a Conservative, Socialist or Liberal
            regime, but extreme Communism. Surely that could not be their
            objective. A Communist Germany would be infinitely more formidable
            than a Communist Russia.”

            professional Boxer in the 40's and 50's. When he was a toddler his
            family moved to Rugby where he grew up. In 1952 he became both the

            Tommy Nutter was born in Barmouth in 1943 but was raised in
            Edgeware. He was famous for reinventing the Savile Row Suit in the
            1960's. He opened up Nutters of Savile Row with the backing of Cilla
            Black and others. His clients included Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger
            and Elton John. He also dressed three of the four Beetles for the
            famous Abbey Road album, with George Harrison deciding to wear
            denim. He also designed the clothing for the Joker played by Jack
            Nicholson in the 1989 Batman film.

            But that is not the only link with this little town. In 1920, Edward

            house Minfor. One morning he suffered a heart attack while eating
            his breakfast and died. He was buried in Llanaber by 4 workmen and
            no family attended the burial. He was Princess Diana's Great Uncle.
