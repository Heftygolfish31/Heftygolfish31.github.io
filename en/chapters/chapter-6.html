          <p><b>Barmouth Town over the years</b></p>
          <p>
            Since early mentions of Barmouth as a settlement, in the 1500's, the
            town has grown in both size and population. Many of the older
            buildings still stand, but some have been demolished and newer ones
            built in their place.

            The picture above shows Northfield Hall (far left), Belle View
            (covered in ivy) and Glan Y Werydd (right) back in 1865. The picture
            is taken from a spot which would now be somewhere on Beach Road. The
            tree seen on the right is where the Tal Y Don stands today. The
            shops and homes on Beach Road have yet to be constructed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next picture is taken from a similar location circa 1870. By
            this time the Richmond Hotel had been constructed (left) and the Tal
            Y Don stands to the right of Glan Y Werydd.

            By 1898 Beach Road had changed dramatically and more resembles how
            it looks today. It now has a road surface and pavements. You can see
            Glan Y Werydd at the end of the street. By this time Siloam Chapel
            had been reconstructed and is visible on the left about half way up
            the road. Christchurch had also been constructed and can be found on
            the right at the far end of the street.

            This is a branch of the family butchers of Llanidloes. Hamer
            established a wide ranging reputation for his Plynlimon mutton. He
            became, by Royal appointment, purveyor of meat to the Prince of
            Wales, Queen Victoria and subsequent members of the Royal Family.
            The late Terry Jones, co-founder of 'Monty Python's Flying Circus',
            who was born in Colwyn Bay and later lived in Lanidloes, was a big
            fan of Hamer's Butchers. He once stated in an interview with the
            Western Mail, Wales' national newspaper, that he wanted to be buried
            in a Hamer's pork pie!

            which was demolished in 1973. It was replaced by a single storey
            brick built commercial building which would house Woolworth until
            they went in to liquidation in 2008. Today the Factory Shop stands
            on the site.

            Pen Y Grisiau is a Grade 2 listed building and was constructed in
            the late 1700's. It is thought to have originally consisted of 3
            independent dwellings, one above the other. Today it is split into a
            commercial property at street level with a private residence above.

            As tourism boomed in the late 1800's and early 1900's the need for

            Parade. This was one of Barmouth's most ambitiously scaled projects

            Another development on Marine Parade was the Pavillion Building.
            This was constructed in 1904 and housed retail premises, including a
            shoe shop, a news agent, a restaurant and a cinema. It was
            eventually demolished in the 1970's after being deemed unsafe and
            was replaced soon after with a more modern brick building housing an
            amusement arcade.

            Although Barmouth Town has grown and changed over the years since it
            was first mentioned as a settlement, many of the older buildings
            still exist, even if their uses have changed. They are still
            recognisable today. If you want to get a feel for how Barmouth was a
            couple of centuries ago, just take a walk around the lanes and steps
            of old Barmouth, known locally as “the rock”, and let your
            imagination wander.
