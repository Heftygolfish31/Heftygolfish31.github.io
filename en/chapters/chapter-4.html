          <p>
            Construction of Barmouth Bridge began in 1864 and was completed in
            1867. The bridge opened on 3rd June of that year to horse drawn
            carriages and on 10th October to locomotives. It was designed and
            constructed for the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway to make an
            Aberystwyth to Pwllheli line. The bridge was originally built with
            113 wooden spans and 8 iron spans. There was a “cock and draw”
            section close to the Barmouth side. The purpose of this draw bridge
            section was to let vessels pass in and out of the Estuary. Thomas
            Savin, a Welsh entrepreneur was the mastermind behind the bridge.
            The construction was difficult due to the strong currents of the
            Mawddach and two men drowned during its build.

          </div>
          <p>
            After the discovery that the underwater iron sections were severely
            corroded in 1899 the drawbridge section was replaced with two steel
            spans. One of the spans used to be a swing bridge so ship could
            continue to pass through.

            A film was shot on the bridge in 1941 called Ghost Train. It starred
            Arthur Askey and was set in Fal, Cornwall. The story involved a
            phantom train that would run through the station and over the
            bridge. The train turned out to be a group of gun smugglers taking
            guns for the Nazis, the climax being the train running off the swing
            bridge part of the bridge and in to the sea. A scale model of the
            bridge was built for this scene by a local butcher's father.

          <p>
            In 1980 divers found Teredo worms had bored in to the timbers of the
            bridge, the holes they had created were large and required repair.
            This project would take five and a half years and stop all trains
            crossing the bridge for this period. The bridge reopened to trains
            in April 1986 and then in 1987 the steel span swing bridge was
            opened for the last time. Barmouth Bridge is still one of the
            longest timber viaducts in Britain.

          <p>
            The building of the bridge saw the decline of ship building but a
            vast increase in tourism. In 1865 Barmouth Junction was built, which
            is now known as Morfa Mawddach. Barmouth Junction allowed trains
            from Barmouth to either branch to Machynlleth / Shrewsbury /
            Aberystwyth or Ruabon via Dolgellau, Bala and Llangollen. Beechings
            cuts in the 1960's saw the closure of the Ruabon line and now the
            old railway embankment to Dolgellau is called the Mawddach Way and
            is popular with walkers and cyclists who wish to enjoy the Estuary.
            Up until the 1960's there was a summer service from London
            Paddington to Pwllheli via Birmingham and Shrewsbury.

          <p><b>The Promenade</b></p>
          <p>
            In 1924 a mini Tsunami hit Barmouth and caused flooding along Marine
            Parade, Wellington Terrace and the area where the Council Estate is
            today. There was also extensive flooding along the Mawddach with
            much of Arthog was under water.

          </div>
          <p>
            Further flooding occurred in 1927 and rudimentary sea defences were
            severely damaged. Much of the promenade was also damaged and it was
            decided to build proper sea defences and a new promenade for
            Barmouth.

          <p>
            In 1928 an extensive construction project began. Originally the
            promenade went as far as the Arbour Hotel / Marine Mansions /
            Sandbanks Hotel but the new prom would extend further North. Local
            workers were used but many of the workforce came from South Wales.
            They were willing to work for less money than the locals and this
            caused a lot of trouble.

          <p>
            So much stone had to be moved and sand dunes had to be removed that
            a purpose built railway line was built that ran the length of the
            prom. By 1933 the works were complete and the ex Prime Minister
            David Lloyd George came to Barmouth, with his wife, to open the new
            sea defences and promenade.

          <p><b>Tourism</b></p>
          <p>
            Although tourism took off a little while after the arrival of the
            railway, it had always existed in some form at Barmouth and the town
            had started to establish its reputation as a resort as early as
            1766. The seasonal trade and maritime commerce established the
            town's prosperity during this time. In this same year a projected
            sale in Dolgellau had an untenanted house called “Barmouth House”
            situated above the quay. It was described as “a delightful house for
            a family for the summer season for sea-bathing”. Could Barmouth
            House be the Barmouth Hotel? When the road was dug up a few years
            ago a quay wall was found underneath the road outside the Hotel, the
            quay was located along Church Street at that time. This shows that
            tourism was considered alive and was advertised back then. By 1795
            more accommodation became available with the opening of the
            Corsygedol Arms. At the time most of the town (now known as Hen
            Bermo) was built on the rock, many little cottages built on tiers
            and peering over the tops of the ones below them, with small paths
            linking them all. It was likened to Gibraltar and parts of
            Edinburgh. This fascinated visitors to the town.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            It was observed that the women in the 18thCentury were more
            industrious than the men. Women were very much involved in the
            commercial goings on of the expanding town. Many husbands and sons
            were away at sea so the women were left to get on with the business
            of the town. During the time of the Corsygedol Arms, the town was
            described as having showy fashionable shops and two or three large
            hotels, of which the Corsygedol was the most popular, with the
            principle street being covered by a bed of sand ankle deep.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            The arrival of the railway did not affect immediate change on the
            town. Barmouth retained its usual visitors to begin with but the
            town experienced hard times with the decline of ship building, then
            about 10 years after the bridge was built an abundant crop of scurvy
            grass was found on the banks of the Mawddach. News of this increased
            the number of visitors especially those with scurvy disease. They
            would come to apply the herb and receive the benefit of hot and cold
            sea water baths in the Bath House (Now the large cafe on the sand at
            the quay). Horse Drawn Bathing Machines were available in the
            1860's. They were probably reversed in to allow the bather to change
            and when finished pulled back out on to the beach, keeping their
            modesty intact. Many of the large granite buildings around the town
            were built during this time period as the town became busier. In
            1880 Slater's Directory Of North and South Wales describes the town
            as containing 3 hotels (the Barmouth, the Corsygedol and the Lion)
            and 4 inns or public houses (the Anchor, the Henblas, the Last and
            the Half Way at Bontddu), 3 of these were run by women. There were
            also 2 temperance hotels and an assembly room. The directory also
            lists 113 Lodging House Keepers, an abundance of trade people and
            shopkeepers, 2 Banks and 13 pleasure boat owners. This shows that
            tourism was strong at this point. Ynys Y Brawd would be engulfed in
            visitors, ferried across the narrow channel.

            Tourism continued into the 1900's with Barmouth offering many of its
            staple attractions. The Fairbourne Railway opened accessible by
            ferry from Barmouth and then a ride from Penrhyn Point to the
            village. At first the carriages were pulled by horses before being
            replaced later by narrow gauge steam locomotives. Entertainment
            groups would visit the area annually and put on shows. Some would
            set up outdoor stages and entertain on the beaches or the promenade.
            A grand building called the Pavilion existed where the fun fair
            stands today. Concerts were held there and eventually a cinema.
            Between 1931 and 1932 newspapers were reporting the following about
            the town:
          </p>
          <p>
            St. James Budget - “A tract of country which, for picturesque
            beauty, is absolutely without a rival.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The World - “The first beauty of Barmouth is the Bridge across the
            Estuary. There is not such a promenade across Europe....... An ideal
            country.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Manchester Guardian - “You hear much comparison made between Wales
            and Switzerland, and when the Panorama Walk of Barmouth is in
            question the comparison is not forced, nor is any apology needed for
            the Welsh Country.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sheffield Daily Guardian - “That wonderful estuary - which is part
            of the charms of Barmouth - .....One of the finest pictures of
            Europe is the Estuary of Barmouth.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lady's Pictorial - “Even lovely Wales can scarcely boast a more
            charming spot than beautiful Barmouth”
          </p>
          <p>
            Western Daily Press, Bristol - “Barmouth is much in favour among a
            select class of visitors who go there year after year. Its charms
            are enhanced by its unrivalled walks and drives and its incomparable
            mountain scenery.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Westminster Gazette - “Barmouth in winter is as sunny as Bermuda and
            as warm. Though as yet people - especially those to whom winter
            sunshine is life - but hardly realise this, the temperature being
            seldom under 40 degrees, while the scenery is as perfect as can be.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Land Agents' Record - “The matchless combination of mountain and
            vale, moorland and waterfall, river and estuary, which has been the
            admiration of people from every clime, has attracted Authors,
            Artists, Scientists, and Naturalists, and the 'Welsh Rhine' with
            it's wonderful association is - 'ever changing, ever new' - has for
            many years been an endless theme.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Nottingham Guardian - “The best insurance against sickness is a week
            in Barmouth. Barmouth is an unequalled centre for seeing all the
            show places in North Wales. A day excursion will take the visitor to
            the top of these famous mountains: Cader Idris, Plynlimon, Moelwyn,
            Diphwys, Snowdon, and the two Arrans.”

            T P.'s Weekly - “Barmouth gives one a great sense of rest. The
            cliffs keep off the East winds. Turner loved the district and
            painted thereabout.”

            The Christian World - “Frost is rarely known in Barmouth, and snow
            seldom lies for many hours together. The winter is very late in
            coming here, and it seems to have spent a good deal of its ill
            temper before it arrives. The town is open to the sea and the sun to
            the south and the west. Wild flowers last from spring to spring. If
            people only knew what Barmouth can be like through the weeks that
            are bad to bear in other places, most of them would arrest their
            flight to the South of France and try Barmouth.”

            As we can see Barmouth was a truly desirable location to those all
            around the UK. The opening of the new promenade and sea defences
            transformed the look and feel of the town along the foreshore.
            Campsites began to expand providing basic camping facilities at
            first, to sites with shops, swimming pools, amusements, pubs, cafes
            and restaurants on site today.

            In 1958 a Chapel on Jubilee Road was converted in to what is now the
            Dragon Theatre giving another venue for shows and concerts. B&B's
            sprang up around the town and many cafe's and pubs opened. A
            causeway was built over to Ynys Y Brawd as a result of many
            drownings in the channel that used to run between the beach and the
            island. This made the island accessible to walkers but blocked the
            channel which many blame for the silting in the harbour today. At
            one point Barmouth had funfairs in two separate locations, the
            existing one and one on the main car park. Annual Regattas were held
            which drew in many tourists to the area. The town then experienced a
            slide in its fortunes with a reputation for being a “kiss me quick
            hat” type holiday catering to cheap vacations with shops in the high
            street boarded up, hotels closed down and many charity shops filling
            empty lets. However in the last few years thanks to the investment
            and innovation of local business people and a proactive town council
            who support and host many events Barmouth has seen a resurgence. The
            high street is now full of high end shops, the pubs and the hotels
            have all been rejuvenated and in some cases reopened. Barmouth can
            boast award winning eateries and top chefs.
